# Project Title

Polynomial calculator - Lets user calculates and evaluates polynomials using the following options:
1) Addition
2) Subtraction
3) Multiplication
4) Division
5) Evaluate

## Overview

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
When starting this console application, the user will be prompted to enter
 two polynomial inputs with the format ax^2 + bx + c (Standard form) before the menu will show up. 
```

## Instructions

```python
When user clicked 1, the two inputs of the users will result to Addition of polynomials

When user clicked 2, the two inputs of the users will result to Subtraction of polynomials

When user clicked 3, the two inputs of the users will result to Multiplication of polynomials

When user clicked 4, the two inputs of the users will result to Division of polynomials but this stage has special restrictions. The user will be prompted to enter new inputs again

When user clicked 5, the user will be prompted to choose between the two:
1) Evaluate input1
2) Evaluate input2

After, they will enter a value of x to start to evaluate the requested polynomial
```
